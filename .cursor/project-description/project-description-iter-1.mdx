## Project Overview

This is a Next.js (v15.3.2) personal portfolio website for Eduard Kakosyan, an AI Developer. It utilizes React (v19) and TypeScript. The styling is primarily handled by Tailwind CSS (v4), with some UI components potentially leveraging Radix UI primitives, as suggested by the presence of `@radix-ui/react-label`, `@radix-ui/react-navigation-menu`, and `@radix-ui/react-slot`. The project uses `next-themes` for theme management (e.g., light/dark mode) and `lucide-react` for icons.

## Key Technologies and Features

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language:** TypeScript
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`
*   **UI:** Radix UI (likely for underlying component structure), `lucide-react` (icons)
*   **Content Management:** Markdown/MDX for blog posts and project descriptions. The processing pipeline includes `unified`, `remark`, `rehype`, `gray-matter`, and `rehype-highlight` for syntax highlighting.
*   **Fonts:** Geist Sans and Geist Mono.
*   **SEO:** Comprehensive metadata setup in the root layout for Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and general search engine optimization.
*   **WebLLM Integration:** The project includes `@mlc-ai/web-llm` and has specific Next.js configurations (headers, Webpack fallbacks for `fs`, `path`, `crypto`, and enabling `asyncWebAssembly`) to support WebLLM functionality. This is a significant feature, likely powering the `Chatbot` component.
*   **Linting/Formatting:** ESLint and likely Prettier (though not explicitly seen, it's common with this stack). TypeScript and ESLint build error checks are currently disabled in `next.config.js` as a temporary measure.
*   **Build Tool:** Next.js with Turbopack for development (`next dev --turbopack`).

## Directory Structure and File Organization

*   **`src/app/`**: Contains the core application logic using the Next.js App Router.
    *   `layout.tsx`: Root layout, sets up global styles, fonts, theme provider, header, footer, and a persistent chatbot.

## Page Structure and Navigation

*   **Homepage (`/`)**:
    *   Displays a `HeroSection`, `AIAssistantSection`, `AIExpertiseSection`, `AchievementsSection`, and `CTASection`.
*   **Main Navigation (Header)**:
    *   Logo and "Eduard Kakosyan" (links to Homepage).
    *   Links: "About", "Projects", "Contact".
*   **Footer**:
    *   Copyright notice.
    *   Links to GitHub and LinkedIn profiles.
*   **Pages**:
    *   **About (`/about`)**: Information about Eduard Kakosyan.
    *   **Projects (`/projects`)**: Lists projects. Likely uses data from `src/content/projects.ts`.
        *   Individual Project Pages (`/projects/[slug]`): Detailed view of a specific project, with content possibly from Markdown files in `src/content/project-descriptions/`.
    *   **Contact (`/contact`)**: Contact information or a contact form.
    *   **Blog (`/blog`)**: Lists blog posts.
        *   Individual Blog Post Pages (`/blog/[slug]`): Displays a single blog post, with content from Markdown files in `src/content/blog/`.

## Key Components and Functionality

*   **Header (`src/components/layouts/header.tsx`)**: Sticky navigation bar with logo, site name, and links to main pages. Uses Radix UI NavigationMenu.
*   **Footer (`src/components/layouts/footer.tsx`)**: Contains copyright and social media links.
*   **ThemeProvider (`src/components/theme-provider.tsx`)**: Manages light/dark mode using `next-themes`.
*   **Chatbot (`src/components/features/chatbot/index.tsx` - path assumed)**: A persistent chatbot feature, likely powered by the WebLLM integration. This is a standout interactive element of the site.
*   **Project System**:
    *   Data for projects is defined in `src/content/projects.ts`.
    *   Each project has properties like title, description, tags, URLs, and a slug.
    *   `longDescription` for each project is loaded from a corresponding Markdown file in `src/content/project-descriptions/`.
    *   Helper functions in `projects.ts` allow fetching all projects, featured projects, projects by slug, etc.
*   **Blog System**:
    *   Blog posts are likely managed as Markdown files in `src/content/blog/`.
    *   `src/lib/blog-utils.ts` probably contains functions to fetch and process blog post data (e.g., reading frontmatter from Markdown).
    *   Dynamic routing (`/blog/[slug]`) is used for individual posts.
*   **Markdown Processing (`src/lib/markdown.ts`)**:
    *   `getMarkdownContent`: Reads raw Markdown content from files.
    *   `markdownToHtml`: Converts Markdown strings to HTML, applying syntax highlighting (`rehype-highlight`) and GFM support.

## Styling and Design

*   **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling. The configuration specifies content paths and includes the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin for styling Markdown-generated HTML.
*   **Theme**: Uses Geist Sans and Geist Mono fonts. Supports light/dark mode.
*   **Colors/Branding**: The logo is `/images/logo.jpeg`. Specific color palette details would be in `globals.css` or defined within Tailwind config/CSS variables, but not explicitly detailed in the file structure scan. The header has a backdrop blur effect.

## Interaction and Data Flow (Simplified)

1.  **User Request**: User navigates to a URL.
2.  **Next.js Routing**: The App Router matches the URL to a page component (e.g., `src/app/projects/page.tsx`).
3.  **Layout Rendering**: The root `layout.tsx` wraps the page component, providing the overall structure (Header, Footer, ThemeProvider, Chatbot).
4.  **Page Component Rendering**:
    *   **Static Pages (e.g., About)**: Render their JSX content.
    *   **Dynamic Pages (e.g., Project Details, Blog Posts)**:
        *   The page component (e.g., `src/app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`) likely uses its `slug` parameter to fetch data.
        *   For projects, it would call functions from `src/content/projects.ts` (e.g., `getProjectBySlug`). This function, in turn, might call `getMarkdownContent` from `src/lib/markdown.ts` to load the detailed description.
        *   The Markdown content is then converted to HTML by `markdownToHtml` (if not done at build time for SSG).
        *   The fetched and processed data is passed as props to the page component for rendering.
    *   **Homepage**: Renders various feature sections, which might internally fetch data if needed (e.g., featured projects for an "Achievements" or "Projects" section).
5.  **Component Rendering**: Individual components (Header, Footer, sections, UI elements) render their respective JSX and apply styles via Tailwind CSS.
6.  **Client-Side Interactivity**:
    *   `Header` uses client-side navigation via `next/link`.
    *   `ThemeProvider` handles theme switching on the client.
    *   The `Chatbot` component provides interactive AI-powered chat, leveraging WebLLM on the client side.
    *   Other client components (`'use client'`) handle user interactions and state updates.

## Mind Map/Relationships

*   **`RootLayout`** is the entry point for UI.
    *   It applies global styles, fonts, and themes (`ThemeProvider`).
    *   It embeds `Header`, `Footer`, and `Chatbot`.
    *   It renders `children` (the current page).
*   **`Page Components`** (e.g., `HomePage`, `AboutPage`, `ProjectsPage`) define the content for specific routes.
    *   They often compose multiple **`Feature Components`** (e.g., `HeroSection`, `ProjectCard`).
    *   Data for dynamic pages (blog, projects) comes from **`Content Sources`** (`src/content/`).
        *   `projects.ts` acts as a data accessor for project information, pulling long descriptions from Markdown files in `project-descriptions/`.
        *   Blog posts are likely individual Markdown files in `src/content/blog/`, processed by `blog-utils.ts` and `markdown.ts`.
*   **`Utility Functions`** (`src/lib/`) support various tasks:
    *   `markdown.ts`: Markdown parsing and conversion.
    *   `utils.ts`: CSS class name management.
*   **`Styling`** is primarily through Tailwind CSS, configured in `tailwind.config.ts` and applied via class names in components.
*   **`WebLLM Integration`** is a core feature, supported by `next.config.js` modifications and the `@mlc-ai/web-llm` package, powering the `Chatbot`.
