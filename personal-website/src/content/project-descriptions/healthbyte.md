## 🚀 Project Overview

HealthByte represents a breakthrough in combating healthcare misinformation through AI-driven simulation and content optimization. This platform anticipates public reactions to healthcare content and actively helps communicators craft more effective, trustworthy messaging.

**The Problem:** Healthcare misinformation spreads faster than factual information, leading to poor medical decisions and public health crises. Traditional approaches to combat this are reactive rather than proactive.

**Our Innovation:** An AI-powered simulation platform that models diverse public reactions to healthcare content, enabling proactive optimization of messaging before publication.

## 🏆 Results & Impact

- **🥇 First Place** at the Atlantic AI Summit 2025 among 20 university teams from across Atlantic Canada
- **Novel Approach:** Pioneered proactive misinformation detection and public sentiment analysis
- **Real-World Application:** Designed for Nova Scotia healthcare communicators, writers, and reporters
- **Scalable Solution:** Built to handle diverse audiences and content types efficiently

## 🔬 Technical Innovation

### Architecture Overview
Our solution employs a sophisticated two-agent reinforcement learning system:

**🤖 Persona Agent (Powered by OpenAI o4-mini)**
- Processes diverse demographic and belief profiles from structured JSON data
- Analyzes healthcare articles with advanced reasoning capabilities
- Generates three-dimensional responses:
  - **Acceptance Rate**: Quantitative trust score (0-100)
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Emotional reaction classification
  - **Reasoning Summary**: Detailed psychological rationale

**✏️ Editor Agent (Content Optimization Engine)**
- Receives persona feedback and sentiment data
- Iteratively refines article content using advanced NLP techniques
- Optimizes messaging for specific audience segments
- Maintains factual accuracy while improving persuasiveness

**🔄 Reinforcement Learning Loop**
- Implements adaptive optimization with up to 15 iterations
- Converges on optimal content for target demographics
- Tracks improvement metrics throughout the optimization process

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with advanced prompt engineering and state management
- **AI Models**: OpenAI SDK with o4-mini for complex reasoning tasks
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Azure OpenAI for scalable deployment and enterprise-grade security
- **Data Management**: Structured JSON for persona profiles and content versioning
- **Visualization**: Custom dashboard built with modern web technologies
